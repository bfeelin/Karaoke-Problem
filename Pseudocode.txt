# Notes

I feel that this is almost a “brute-force” solution, although I could not think of a more efficient way. It was not specified in the problem, but if the input was ordered by score, a comparison between the winning total and (current total + current score) could be added to the innermost for loop that would shorten execution time in some cases. 
I have included pseudocode of the findBest() method

# Pseudocode
For every group
{
	For every compatible group
	{
		Find what group is compatible with current 2
		For every matching group
		{
			If score for this group > current winner of 3rd spot
				Current winner of 3rd = this score
		}
    If no compatible 3rd group found
	    Continue for loop
    If total for these 3 groups > current winner
			Current winner = this total
			Continue for loop
  }
}
